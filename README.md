Clothesline System with Automated Rain Detection - Arduino Project

Clothesline System

Description:

The Clothesline System with Automated Rain Detection is an Arduino-based project that aims to simplify the task of drying clothes outdoors by automatically retracting the clothesline when it detects rain or adverse weather conditions. The project utilizes various sensors, an Arduino board, and a stepper motor to achieve this automation.

Features:

Automated Rain Detection: The system is equipped with a rain sensor that detects raindrops or moisture on the sensor's surface. When rain is detected, the system automatically retracts the clothesline to protect the clothes from getting wet.

Humidity and Temperature Monitoring: A DHT (Digital Humidity and Temperature) sensor is used to monitor the ambient humidity and temperature. This information can be valuable for users to determine the optimal time to hang clothes for drying.

Light Intensity Sensing: An LDR (Light Dependent Resistor) is employed to measure the ambient light intensity. The system can take this data into account while deciding whether or not to retract the clothesline. For instance, it may not retract the line during low light conditions even if rain is detected.

Stepper Motor Control: The project utilizes a stepper motor to control the clothesline's movement. When rain is detected or unfavorable conditions are sensed, the motor rotates, retracting the clothesline. Upon improved conditions, it reverses the rotation to extend the clothesline again.

Remote Monitoring with Thingspeak Integration: The system is integrated with the Thingspeak platform to allow users to remotely monitor the status of the clothesline system. Users can view real-time data such as temperature, humidity, and rain status through the Thingspeak web interface or mobile app.

Usage:

Mount the sensors (rain sensor, DHT sensor, and LDR) at suitable positions to ensure accurate readings.

Connect the Arduino board to the sensors and the stepper motor following the pin definitions provided in the code.

Upload the provided Arduino code to the board to enable the automated functionality.

Power on the system and ensure it is connected to a Wi-Fi network for Thingspeak integration.

Hang clothes on the clothesline as usual, and the system will take care of retracting the line during unfavorable weather conditions.

Note: This project is a work-in-progress, and the code and system may be subject to further improvements and refinements.
